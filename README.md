# Overview
Our team is developing a computer vision and machine learning system to detect abnormal postures and involuntary movements from live video aboard ambulances. Using a top- or side-mounted camera to collect live data, the system will be trained to recognize signs of neurological distress. This detection module will feed into NeuroSpringâ€™s Virtual Neurologist detection tool, an autonomous diagnostic suite (under development).
